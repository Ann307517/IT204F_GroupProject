List of ideas
    - Motion sensors in classrooms
    -Gps tracker on watch: works by detecting user's heartbeat and pulse rate, in
    the event of an emergency where user is in danger, it sends gps cords to first responders
    -Eye tracker for laziness
    -digital coding dictionary
    -(scam c all detector)
    -Infrared drones. When a group of people are lost in a cave, authorities can send those drones deep
    down into the caves and detect any large heat source. If drone detects heat source similar to human, it'll automatically
    send an alert and authorities can follow up on it.
